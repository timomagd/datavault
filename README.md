# DataVault
Regain your internet freedom with a home server :)

Goal of this project is to help begginers build and manage their own personal server. By using Ansible roles to setup basic services that offer a free (as in libre) way to opt-out of Big Tech surveillace.

## ToDo:
* [ ] Create roles that harden security
* [ ] Create roles that install services
