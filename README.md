# DataVault
Regain your internet freedom with a home server :)

Goal of this project is to help begginers build and manage their own personal server by using Ansible roles to setup OpenMediaVault on RaspberryPi OS.
Once the server is setup its easy to host services in containters that offer a free (as in libre) way to opt-out of Big Tech surveillace.
